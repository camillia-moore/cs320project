# cs320project

Code for the project is in the folder GameStateTesting
wasn't sure which stuff needed to be left out, so I just included everything
Currently, code is a hodgepodge from 2 tutorials
	- https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/5_adding_basic_code.html
		used for keyboard input
	- https://github.com/GrayShadoz/MonoGameRaceTrack
		small snippets taken to get game states between multiple class files working
Aside from these two tutorials, rest of code is either the monogame template file, or me choosing class names and keyboard keys

Currently, after running thru Visual Studio, you can use the arrow keys to change the state
	Up: Menu
	Left: Character Creation
	Down: Story
	Right: Battle

Based on other tutorials, it seems good practice is to have a .cs file for each class, and to have them stored in folders on the root directory of the project

README probably needs formating, and this repo unfortunatly probably needs restructuring
